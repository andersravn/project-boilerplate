## Implementation Guidelines

<Alert title="Design System Approach">
  Create a consistent design system with reusable components and patterns to ensure interface consistency across all parts of the CMS.
</Alert>

### Development Best Practices

1. **Component Library**: Build reusable UI components
2. **Design Tokens**: Use consistent spacing, colors, and typography values
3. **User Testing**: Test interface designs with actual content editors
4. **Iterative Design**: Continuously improve based on user feedback
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track interface performance and user behavior

### Testing Checklist

- **Usability Testing**: Observe users completing common tasks
- **Accessibility Testing**: Use screen readers and keyboard-only navigation
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure consistency across different browsers
- **Mobile Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
- **Performance Testing**: Measure load times and interaction responsiveness

<Alert variant="warning" title="User-Centered Design">
  Always design with your actual users in mind. What works for developers may not work for content editors who use the system daily.
