## Implementation Guidelines

<Alert title="Performance First">
  Design with performance in mind from the beginning. It's much harder to optimize a slow system than to build a fast one from the start.
</Alert>

### Development Best Practices

1. **Performance Budget**: Set and monitor performance metrics
2. **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching at multiple levels
3. **Database Optimization**: Design efficient queries and indexes
4. **Asset Optimization**: Compress and optimize all static assets
5. **Code Splitting**: Load only necessary code for each page/feature

### Testing & Monitoring

- **Performance Testing**: Regular testing with realistic data volumes
- **Load Testing**: Simulate concurrent users and high traffic
- **Mobile Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices and networks
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Track performance metrics in production
- **User Experience Testing**: Monitor real user performance data

### Performance Metrics to Track

- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Server response time
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: When content first appears
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: When main content loads
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Visual stability
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Interactivity responsiveness

<Alert variant="warning" title="Performance vs Features">
  Balance feature richness with performance. Sometimes simpler solutions perform better and provide a better user experience than complex feature-heavy alternatives.
