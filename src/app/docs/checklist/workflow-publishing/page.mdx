## Implementation Strategy

<Alert title="Workflow Complexity">
  Start with simple draft/publish workflows and gradually add complexity. Complex approval workflows can slow down publishing if not implemented thoughtfully.
</Alert>

### Phase 1: Core Publishing
1. Basic draft/publish states
2. Simple preview functionality
3. One-click publishing
4. Basic version history

### Phase 2: Enhanced Workflow
1. Content scheduling
2. Enhanced preview options
3. Comment and collaboration features
4. Notification system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Approval workflows
2. Advanced automation
3. External integrations
4. Analytics and reporting

### Technical Considerations

- **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSockets or server-sent events for live collaboration
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous edits gracefully
- **Performance**: Ensure workflow features don't slow down the core editing experience
- **Scalability**: Design workflows that work with large teams and high content volumes

<Alert variant="warning" title="User Training">
  Complex workflows require user training. Provide clear documentation and onboarding for workflow features to ensure adoption.
